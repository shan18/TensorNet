The file [tensornet_simple.ipynb](tensornet_simple.ipynb) demonstrates how to use basic functionalities for training a deep neural network like
- Setting up data and data loaders
- Data Augmentation
- Displaying model summary
- Model training and validation
- Basic result analysis

## Advanced Use

The file [tensornet_advanced.ipynb](tensornet_advanced.ipynb) demonstrates the use of some advanced features that can be used during model training like
- Plotting changes in validation accuracy and loss while model training
- Displaying correct and incorrect predictions of a trained model
- Using One Cycle Policy for training
- Using LR Range Test to find the learning rate boundaries for the One Cycle Policy
- Displaying Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (GradCAM)
